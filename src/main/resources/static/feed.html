            <title>Diets not linked to reduced risk of dementia, study finds</title>
            <description>A number of studies have suggested that eating a healthy diet may reduce a person's risk of
                dementia, but a new study has found that two diets including the Mediterranean diet are not linked to a
                reduced risk of dementia.

            <title>Brain changes can be studied in very early stages of neurodegenerative diseases</title>
            <description>Many changes take place in the brain long before symptoms appear. This has been shown in mice
                in two studies of prion diseases in which the brain gradually deteriorates.

            <title>Omega-3 levels could play a role in improving cognitive resilience in middle-aged people</title>
            <description>An exploratory study suggests that people who eat more foods with omega-3 fatty acids in
                midlife may have better thinking skills and even better brain structure than people who eat few foods
                with the fatty acids.

            <title>Decline in specific protein levels linked to Alzheimer’s disease, not buildup of amyloid
                plaques</title>
            <description>New research from the University of Cincinnati bolsters a hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease
                is caused by a decline in levels of a specific protein, contrary to a prevailing theory that has been
                recently called into question.

            <title>Study identifies a potential biological marker to help diagnose postpartum depression</title>
            <description>A federally funded study led by Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers discovered that
                communication among cells is altered in pregnant women who go on to develop postpartum depression (PPD)
                after giving birth.

            <description>In a recent study, researchers from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and other universities
                in China have reported that brain stimulation combined with a nose spray containing nanoparticles can
                improve recovery after ischemic stroke in an animal model.

            <title>Study explores the role of air pollution on the trajectory of stroke</title>
            <description>Air pollution has been widely associated with an increased risk of stroke. A new study looks at
                the role of air pollution on the trajectory of stroke, including cardiovascular events after first
                stroke and death.
